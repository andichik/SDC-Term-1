This is project 2 of Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. The objective of this project is to utilize what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. My model is trained, validated, and tested with [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). I later test the model with my own, provided images and analyze the model's performance. Detailed Write-up of Implementation is found [Here](https://github.com/andichik/SDC-Term-1/blob/master/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/writeup.md)
